# DMC-1 design walkthrough

The DMC-1 design is in the file [`dmc-1.si`](../hardware/GPUs/dmc-1/dmc-1.si) (it contains many comments).

In the same directory there are a number of helper units which are not strictly part of the DMC-1 but are provided to help assemble a SOC: a [fifo command queue](../hardware/GPUs/dmc-1/command_queue.si) to store draw calls before sending them to the GPU, and screen drivers for a [SPI](../hardware/GPUs/dmc-1/spi_screen.si) and [parallel](../hardware/GPUs/dmc-1/parallel_screen.si) interface.

These are used to assemble a complete SOC including a RISC-V processor in [`soc-ice40-dmc-1-risc_v.si`](../hardware/SOCs/ice40-dmc-1/soc-ice40-dmc-1-risc_v.si).
